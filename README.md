> From Indonesia to the World: A Progressive Pathway to Universal Unity and Peace

## About

Tuhan.org is pioneering a new pathway for spiritual connection on Earth. By intertwining universally accepted truths with the principles of science, we are forging a progressive religion that transcends barriers and unites humanity.

Founded in 2023 by Adi Pramono, Tuhan.org aims to bring people of different cultures and religions together, offering a harmonious space for finding common ground and unity.

## Core Values

Our religion is built upon nine fundamental core values:

- **Integrity**: Honesty, fairness, and a commitment to doing the right thing.
- **Respect**: Treating others with kindness, empathy, and consideration.
- **Responsibility**: Being accountable for your actions and taking ownership of your work.
- **Excellence**: Commitment to quality and a desire to continually improve.
- **Innovation**: Willingness to think creatively and embrace new factual knowledge and ideas.
- **Collaboration**: Working well with others and valuing diverse perspectives.
- **Diversity**: Embracing differences and fostering a culture of inclusion.
- **Sustainability**: Being mindful of the impact of actions on the environment to protect natural resources.
- **Community**: Commitment to making a positive impact in the world and giving back to others.

## Universal Truth

A universal truth is a concept or idea that is believed to be true or accepted as true by the majority of people. It is something that is widely accepted as being factual or real, regardless of culture, time period, or individual perspective.

Some examples of universal truths include:

- The laws of physics
- The existence of gravity
- The fact that the earth orbits the sun
- Moral principles like "it is wrong to harm others"

Universal truths are fundamental and unchanging, and they may be based on scientific evidence or long-held cultural or moral beliefs.
