## What is a universal truth?
A universal truth is a concept or idea that is believed to be true or accepted as true by the majority of people. It is something that is widely accepted as being factual or real, regardless of culture, time period, or individual perspective.

Some examples of universal truths might include the laws of physics, the existence of gravity, and the fact that the earth orbits the sun. These are things that are widely accepted as true and are not disputed by the majority of people. Other universal truths might include moral principles, such as the belief that it is wrong to harm others or that honesty is generally a good quality to have.

Universal truths are often thought to be fundamental and unchanging, and they may be based on scientific evidence or long-held cultural or moral beliefs. While it is possible for a universal truth to be challenged or proven false, it is generally accepted as true until there is strong evidence to the contrary.
